# Intern Assignment checker - GenAI & FastAPI Based Code & Documentation Analyzer

## Overview

This project is a FastAPI application leveraging the power of the Gemini's Generative AI API that allows users to upload a project folder (in ZIP format) for code and README analysis. The application evaluates the quality of the code, generates improved code suggestions, and assesses the quality of the README documentation. The results are presented through a web interface, making it easy for developers to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their projects.
